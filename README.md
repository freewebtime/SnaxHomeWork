## Task 1
```While playing the game, choose three performance issues that you noticed or suspect.```

<i>In real life I'd like to profile the system and collect as many data as possible before starting any speculations about the solutions to the issues. 
</i>

* <b>First issue</b>: long initial loading. 

  Initial Loading Screen. I assume it's waiting for establishing connection with server, authorization and all the initial resources are loading. 
  
  <img src="Readme/Images/GameScreenshotLoading.png" height="350" />
  
  * <b>If it's initial assets loading bottleneck</b>: Reduce resources needed for initial loading, avoid unnecessary big assets. May be some assets can be loaded in background while user is in main screen?
  
  * <b>If it's communication with server bottleneck</b>: Allow user to play before the connection to the server is established and authorization is done. After synchronizing with server in case the local cached user state is invalid, the correct one from server is used. Then if user managed to play a level or two between the application load and authorization completed, we merge local user's progress with the one from server. For instance, adding two completed levels to user's history. 


* <b>Second issue</b>: lag while creating new game objects.

  There is a significant lag before a new game object appears on scene, and it's proportionally longer if there is a lot of new objects are created simultaneously. I assume that there may be heavy game objects structure that has to be instantiated, as well as some initialization logic for each created game object that takes time to process. This issue is noticable when playing puzzles as well as when openning popups, especially on weak phone. 

  * <b>If it's expensive object instantiation</b>. Can be fixed by using Object Pooling. The idea is that after a game object is no longer needed, it's not destroyed, but instead deactivated and saved for reuse. Next time there is a request to create a same game object, the old one is activated and reused. 

  * <b>If it's heavy initialization logic</b>. Reduce logic on game object, insted use them as DOM-objects, as a View for your data. This way the same game object can be used to display different data of the same type (state), it's easy to reuse and is lightweight as possible.

* <b>Third issue</b>: lag before openning a new puzzle the first time.

  <img src="Readme/Images/GameScreenshotNewPuzzle.png" height="350" />

  Looks like puzzles are extracted from AssetBundles, and those bundles are downloadable. So a User has to wait until the data bundle is downloaded (if not already) and extracted and then initialized. 

  * <b>If it's waiting for downloading the asset bundle</b>: the solution is simple: preload the bundle upfront. At least there where it's clear which ones will be needed soon. 

  * <b>If it's waiting for instantiation (extracting from bundle)</b>: we make contents of the asset bundle (in fact, almost whole game objects tree) as lightweight as possible, avoid heavy initialization logic, so instantiation happens faster.

## Task 2

First issue: ```Here is a short video showing an in-game issue: Game Issue```

![Issue 1](Readme/Images/Task2_Issue1.PNG "Issue 1")

The first issue shows UI icons turning black instead of colorful (if I understood the issue right). The problem is with rendering, not with logic. So it's shader error, material error or lighting error. 
* If it's a shader error, we have to check the shader. It might use some special keywords like _GLOW, _BLENDMODE_ADD, _EMISSION_ON. If so, check if those keywords are enabled at runtime correctly. Project Settings -> Graphics -> Shader Stripping -> Disable Unused Variants. Then, we may want to warm up variants using ShaderVariantsCollection or Addressables preload.
* Theoretically it can be a lit shader on Screen-space UI. Screen-space UI does not have lighting and lit material renders as it would without any lights, so it's black. If so, change the shader to unlit, the one that does not use lighting.
* Also we have to check the render queue of the material. It must be after the opaque materials have rendered already, so Render Queue must be Transparent, and the shader must blend colors using Blend SrcAlpha OneMinusSrcAlpha.


Second issue: ```Here is another short video showing an in-game issue: Game Issue```

![Issue 2](Readme/Images/Task2_Issue2.PNG "Issue 2")

This issue shows the pink overlay on top of the water. We can see that the pink artefacts are actually rect-shaped, meaning those are particles that don't have their material (so it's pink). 
* So the problem is clearly with particles that are supposed to be on top of a water. This time I'd say that the material is not loaded (may be the material is not included in an asset bundle). If so, we just need to ensure that the material is correct and available at runtime for the device we test it on. 
* May be also the shader is broken, so it does not compile. This way we have to check a console for error - shader compilation errors must be there. Also we can use Frame Debugger for help.

## Task 3
```Build a small hub scene that streams two puzzle-themed sub-scenes additively using Addressables, triggered by proximity via a simple grid-based controller. Keep visuals minimal; we care about correctness, clarity, and a clean lifecycle.```

![Test Home Work](Readme/Images/Runtime1.PNG)

* Open the Hub scene

  ![Hub scene](Readme/Images/HubScene.PNG)

* Press Play
  
  ![Test Home Work](Readme/Images/Runtime2.PNG)

* Yellow square represents a cursor. Use WASD keys to move it thorugh the grid

  ![Controls](Readme/Images/PuzzleController.PNG)

* Upon approaching loading distance, zones will be loaded and streamed. There are two zones: Zone_A and Zone_B with corresponding scene each. To setup zones, open the Hub scene in Unity Editor and set values on ```ZoneConfigurationAuthoring``` component. 

  ![Authoring Zone_A](Readme/Images/Authoring_Zone_A.PNG)

* Puzzle Grid (or game field) is a 100 static cubes each indicating it's own cell. 

  ![Authoring Zone_B](Readme/Images/Authoring_Zone_B.PNG)

* Yellow cube represents a cursor the User can move with WASD keys, and the distance to which determines which zones must be loaded and which must be unloaded.

  ![Cursor View](Readme/Images/CursorView.PNG)

* ZoneStreamer component knows where which zone is and controls zones loading/unloading based on distance from the zone center to the cursor and each zone configuration.

  ![Zone Streamer](Readme/Images/ZoneStreamer.PNG)

* Configure zones in editor on Hub scene (no need to open Zone_A or Zone_B scene for that)

  ![Authoring Zone_B](Readme/Images/Authoring_Zone_B.PNG)

* Commented code for easy understanding what's going on there
